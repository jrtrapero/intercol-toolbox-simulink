# intercol-toolbox-simulink
In this repository we will include all the files required to run supply chain simulations implemented in SIMULINK.
An example of how the toolbox works can be found in the pdf document (CIO2017_TraperoFinalv2.pdf)
To reproduce the example of the conference paper, it is needed the files: examplesupplychainCIO.m  and exintercol.slx
The toolbox in simulink is available in SCMS.slx with the blocks implemented so far. Hopefully, more blocks will be available soon.
